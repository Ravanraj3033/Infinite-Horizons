These procedures are used to tighten and lift the skin around the abdomen, arms, thighs, and buttocks. By using resorbable threads, individuals can achieve smoother and firmer body contours without the need for surgical interventions. The body segment is gaining traction as people seek more accessible and affordable options to improve their appearance and boost their self-confidence.
